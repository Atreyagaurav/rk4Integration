# rk4Integration
Integration of a function using rk4 method, taking the function as the input string.
## How it works
It just writes a python program with your input string as the function in the program, and runs the python which does the remaing work.
## Extras
The Ascii_temp file gives you the ascii code of whatever you type. just somehting i made for some purpose i don't remember now.

* NOTE: You need python 3 to run it successfully.
